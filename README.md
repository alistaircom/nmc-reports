# Interactive NMC Reports

Interactive view of NMC Reports 2004-2017

Inspired by [Audrey Watters](http://horizon.hackeducation.com) who aggregated content from NMC Reports from 2004-2017, but presented them in a non-usable format (an image). The project is designed to show an interactive version of the same table.

## Known Issues

* The current version is pretty rough, from a CSS and JS point of view, but the project was designed to get off the ground, worrying less about efficient code to begin with.
* Some table cells de-select themselves when they are "related" issues.  I know why this happens, but haven't addressed it yet.  I will.
* No mobile version as yet. I have some ideas as to how to develop that.
